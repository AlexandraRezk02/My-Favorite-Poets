            <h2 class="title">Edgar Allan Poe</h2>
            <div class="image"><img src="images/edgar-allan-poe-portrait.jpg" /></div>
            <p class="summary">Poe was born on January 19, 1809 in Boston Massachesetts and passed away on October 7, 1849. Poe published many poems and stories before he passed away. In total, Poe wrote (at least) 73 short stories and 53 poems. His most famous works are <i>The Raven</i>, <i>The Fall of the House of Usher</i>, and <i>The Tell-Take Heart</i>. My personal favorite is <i>Cupid and Psyche</i></p>

            <h2 class="title">Emily Dickinson</h2>
            <div class="image"><img src="images/155_EmilyDickinsonSmall.jpg" /></div>
            <p class="summary">Dickinson was born on December 10, 1830 in Amherst, Massachusetts and passed away on May 15, 1886. Most of Dickinson's poems weren't published until her sister, Lavinia Dickinson, discovered them after Emily's death. The compilation, <i>THe Poems of Emily Dickinson</i>, wasn't published until 1995. I love the way her poems are written.</p>
